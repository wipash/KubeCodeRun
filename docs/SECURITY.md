# Security Documentation

## Overview

The Code Interpreter API implements multiple layers of security to ensure safe code execution and protect against common web application vulnerabilities.

## Authentication

### API Key Authentication

All API endpoints (except health checks and documentation) require authentication using an API key.

#### Providing API Key

The API key can be provided in two ways:

1. **x-api-key header** (recommended):

   ```bash
   curl -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" https://api.example.com/sessions
   ```

2. **Authorization header**:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" https://api.example.com/sessions
   ```

#### Configuration

Set the API key in your environment:

```bash
export API_KEY="your-secure-api-key-here"
```

Or in your `.env` file:

```
API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here
```

**Important**: Use a strong, randomly generated API key in production.

### Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:

- **Authentication failures**: Max 10 failed attempts per IP per hour
- **API key validation**: Results are cached for 5 minutes to improve performance
- **Request rate limiting**: Additional rate limiting can be configured per endpoint

## Security Middleware

### Security Headers

All responses include security headers:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### Request Validation

- **Content-Type validation**: Only allowed content types are accepted
- **Request size limits**: Configurable maximum request size
- **Input sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized

### File Security

#### Filename Validation

Uploaded files are validated for:

- **Path traversal prevention**: `../` and `\` characters are blocked
- **Null byte injection**: Null bytes in filenames are rejected
- **File extension whitelist**: Only allowed file extensions are accepted
- **Filename length limits**: Maximum 255 characters
- **Suspicious characters**: Special characters that could be dangerous are blocked

#### Allowed File Extensions

```
.txt, .csv, .json, .xml, .yaml, .yml,
.py, .js, .ts, .go, .java, .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp,
.rs, .php, .rb, .r, .f90, .d,
.md, .rst, .html, .css,
.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .svg,
.pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx
```

### Code Execution Security

#### Code Validation

Code is analyzed for potentially dangerous patterns:

- **System imports**: `import os`, `import subprocess`, etc.
- **Dangerous functions**: `eval()`, `exec()`, `__import__()`, etc.
- **File operations**: `open()`, `file()`, etc.
- **Input functions**: `input()`, `raw_input()`, etc.

**Note**: Dangerous patterns generate warnings but don't block execution, as the code runs in isolated containers.

#### Container Isolation

- **Docker containers**: All code runs in isolated Docker containers
- **Resource limits**: Memory and CPU limits are enforced
- **Network isolation**: External network access is blocked by default
- **Filesystem isolation**: Limited filesystem access within containers

#### Container Hardening (Host Info Protection)

Containers are hardened to prevent information leakage about the host infrastructure.
This prevents reconnaissance attacks that could reveal details about your cloud provider,
kernel version, or internal network configuration.

**Currently Implemented**:

| Feature | Protection |
|---------|------------|
| Generic hostname | All containers use hostname "sandbox" instead of revealing host info |
| Empty DNS search domain | WAN containers have empty search domain to prevent Azure/cloud domain leakage |
| Public DNS only | WAN containers use only public DNS (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1) |

**Configuration**:

```bash
# Enable/disable host info masking (default: true)
CONTAINER_MASK_HOST_INFO=true

# Custom generic hostname (default: sandbox)
CONTAINER_GENERIC_HOSTNAME=sandbox
```

**Note**: Kernel version (`/proc/version`) and CPU/memory info (`/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`)
remain accessible because many libraries depend on them. The hostname and DNS hardening above
addresses the primary concern of revealing cloud provider and internal network details.

### WAN-Only Network Access

The Code Interpreter API supports an optional WAN-only network mode that allows
execution containers to access the public internet while maintaining strict
isolation from internal networks.

#### Overview

When enabled via `ENABLE_WAN_ACCESS=true`, execution containers are connected
to a special Docker network that:

1. **Allows**: Outbound connections to public internet IPs (all ports)
2. **Blocks**: Access to private IP ranges, Docker host, and other containers

#### Blocked IP Ranges

The following ranges are blocked via iptables rules:

| Range | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `10.0.0.0/8` | Class A private network |
| `172.16.0.0/12` | Class B private network (includes Docker networks) |
| `192.168.0.0/16` | Class C private network |
| `169.254.0.0/16` | Link-local (includes cloud metadata services) |
| `127.0.0.0/8` | Loopback |
| `224.0.0.0/4` | Multicast |
| `240.0.0.0/4` | Reserved |

#### Configuration

```bash
# Enable WAN access (default: false)
ENABLE_WAN_ACCESS=true

# Custom network name (optional)
WAN_NETWORK_NAME=code-interpreter-wan

# Custom DNS servers (optional, defaults to Google and Cloudflare DNS)
WAN_DNS_SERVERS=8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1,8.8.4.4
```

#### Security Considerations

1. **iptables Required**: The API container needs `NET_ADMIN` capability to
   manage iptables rules. This is automatically configured in docker-compose.yml.

2. **Public DNS Only**: Only public DNS servers are used to prevent DNS-based
   attacks that could leak internal network information.

3. **No Inter-Container Communication**: The WAN network has ICC (inter-container
   communication) disabled. Containers cannot communicate with each other.

4. **Cloud Metadata Blocked**: The link-local range (169.254.0.0/16) is blocked,
   which includes cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254) used by AWS, GCP,
   and Azure.

5. **IPv4 Only**: The current implementation focuses on IPv4. IPv6 would require
   separate ip6tables rules.

6. **Default Off**: WAN access is disabled by default for maximum security.

#### When to Enable WAN Access

Enable WAN access when:
- Users need to download packages or dependencies (pip, npm, etc.)
- Code needs to fetch data from public APIs
- Web scraping or data collection is required

Keep WAN access disabled (default) when:
- Maximum security isolation is required
- All dependencies are pre-installed in container images
- Code should not have any network access

#### Audit Logging

WAN-enabled containers are tracked via labels:
- `com.code-interpreter.wan-access=true` on each container
- Network initialization and iptables rule application are logged at startup

### State Persistence Security

Python state persistence introduces additional security considerations:

#### Serialization Security

- **Serialization inside containers**: State is serialized within the isolated container, not on the host. The host never unpickles user data.
- **cloudpickle usage**: We use cloudpickle for serialization. While pickle-based formats can execute code during deserialization, this only occurs inside the sandboxed container.
- **Compression**: State is compressed with lz4 before storage, providing minor obfuscation and reducing attack surface.
- **Base64 encoding**: Final storage uses base64 encoding for safe transport.

#### Storage Security

- **Redis encryption**: Consider enabling Redis TLS in production for encrypted state storage
- **MinIO encryption**: Enable server-side encryption for archived states
- **TTL-based cleanup**: States automatically expire (2 hours in Redis, 7 days in MinIO archives)
- **Size limits**: `STATE_MAX_SIZE_MB` prevents denial-of-service via large states

#### Session Isolation

- **Session binding**: State is bound to `session_id`, not directly accessible by other sessions
- **User scoping**: Sessions are scoped by `user_id` and `entity_id`
- **No cross-session access**: One user's session cannot access another user's state

#### Disabling State Persistence

If state persistence poses unacceptable risk for your use case:

```bash
STATE_PERSISTENCE_ENABLED=false
```

This ensures each execution starts with a clean namespace.

#### Audit Events

State persistence operations are logged:

- State save (size, session_id)
- State load (session_id, source: redis/minio)
- State archive (session_id)
- State size limit exceeded (warning)

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging

All security-relevant events are logged:

- **Authentication attempts**: Success and failure
- **File operations**: Upload, download, delete
- **Code execution**: Language, warnings, success/failure
- **Rate limiting**: When limits are exceeded

### Log Format

```json
{
  "event_type": "authentication",
  "success": true,
  "api_key_prefix": "abc123...",
  "client_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "endpoint": "GET /sessions",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Monitoring Endpoints

- **Authentication stats**: Get authentication failure statistics
- **Rate limit status**: Check current rate limit status
- **Security events**: Query recent security events

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# API Key (required)
API_KEY=your-secure-api-key

# Resource Limits
MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=30          # seconds
MAX_MEMORY_MB=512             # megabytes
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10           # megabytes per file
MAX_FILES_PER_SESSION=50      # files per session
MAX_OUTPUT_FILES=10           # output files per execution

# Redis for caching and rate limiting
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=optional-password
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Use strong API keys**: Generate cryptographically secure random keys
2. **Enable HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
3. **Monitor logs**: Regularly review security logs for suspicious activity
4. **Update dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date
5. **Network isolation**: Deploy in a private network when possible
6. **Resource monitoring**: Monitor resource usage and set appropriate limits

## Incident Response

### Authentication Failures

If you see repeated authentication failures:

1. Check the source IP in logs
2. Verify the API key is correct
3. Consider blocking suspicious IPs at the network level
4. Rotate API keys if compromise is suspected

### Suspicious Code Execution

If dangerous code patterns are detected:

1. Review the code content in logs
2. Check the session and user context
3. Consider additional code validation rules
4. Monitor container resource usage

### File Upload Issues

For suspicious file uploads:

1. Check filename validation logs
2. Review file content if necessary
3. Verify file size and type restrictions
4. Monitor storage usage

## Security Updates

This security documentation should be reviewed and updated regularly as new threats emerge and security measures are enhanced.
